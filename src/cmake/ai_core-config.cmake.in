# --- Self-defined macro to avoid external dependencies ---
# This macro is a minimal, self-contained implementation inspired by
# CMake's standard macro and practices seen in other robust libraries
# like yaml-cpp. It ensures this config file works even if CMake's
# standard modules aren't in the search path during find_package().
